![it me](/media/headshot.jpg)

I’m a product manager at WARC, the world’s largest advertising information service.

I researched and wrote the Future of Strategy report, a deep dive into one of advertising’s most important but least-understood disciplines.

I also led development on the WARC 100, [now WARC Rankings](https://www.warc.com/rankings), one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.

I came to product management via General Assembly, having previously worked as a financial journalist.

I hold an MA from the University of Bristol. I write about visual art each week on my other website, Artangled. I write about everything else I’m interested in here. Offline, I’m an avid bibliophile and traveller.
