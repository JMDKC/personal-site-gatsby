![joseph clift headshot](/media/headshot.jpg)

I'm a [certified Scrum Master](/media/josephclift_PSMI_certificate.pdf), currently working in digital delivery at [Which?](https://which.co.uk), the UK's consumer champion.

Previously, I worked at [Ascential](https://www.ascential.com/), a FTSE 250-listed information services company.

With live events hammered by the global pandemic, I helped guide the [Cannes Lions festival](https://canneslions.com), aka the Oscars of advertising, to its most successful ever digital activation. Before that, I led development on the WARC 100, [now WARC Rankings](https://www.warc.com/rankings), one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.

I started on my - far from complete - journey to Agile via General Assembly, having previously worked as a financial journalist.

I hold an MA from the University of Bristol. I write about visual art each week on my other website, [Artangled](http://artangled.com). I write about everything else I’m interested in here. Offline, I’m an avid bibliophile and traveller.
